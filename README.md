# Arduino Primo Tutorials

Here some tutorial to explain and show how to use make use of the new features on the Arduino Primo and Arduino Primo Core, 
such as Wifi, BLE, NFC, InfraRed and various sensors. Hope you will keep using Arduino to create amazing stuff, save the 
planet or make a cool project to look smart at the dinning table with your uncles.

You can find here a summary of the projects I developed. More information can be found by opening the single projects.

* Heart Rate Monitor   
    An Arduino Primo board uses a pulse sensor to record information about your heart rate and sends them to your 
    smartphone via BLE. The information are displayed by mean of the Nordic nRF Toolbox App, that should be downloaded 
    directly on your smartphone.
    Shows how to process the incoming information from a sensor, how to organise them following the BLE protocols,
    use the libraries

* Digital Pinboard   
    A short message can be stored on an Arduino Primo board using a smartphone through the Nordic nRF Connect App, or 
    with other devices.
    The message can then be read by any device with NFC enabled by bringing it near to the board.
    Shows how to use NFC features and how to combine them with Bluetooth to make it more dynamic and versatile.
